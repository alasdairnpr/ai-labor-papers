    "abstract": "We study the effects of the increase in industrial robot usage between 1990 and 2007 on US local labor markets. Using a model in which robots compete against human labor in the production of different tasks, we show that robots may reduce employment and wages.",
    "summary": "Landmark study finding that each robot added per 1,000 workers reduced employment-to-population ratio by 0.2% and wages by 0.42%. Effects concentrated in manufacturing and among workers without college degrees.",

    "abstract": "Digital computers have transformed work in almost every sector of the economy, but their full effects on jobs is only beginning to be felt. We discuss what machine learning can and cannot do, and the resistance certain tasks have to automation.",
    "summary": "Framework for understanding which tasks are susceptible to ML automation. Identifies prediction as the key capability, and argues displacement effects depend on whether ML complements or substitutes for human judgment.",
