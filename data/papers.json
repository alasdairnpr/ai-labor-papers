Access to the tool increased issues resolved per hour by ~14% on average (and +34% for novice workers, with minimal gains for experienced workers). The AI helpdesk disseminated best practices, boosted productivity especially for junior staff, improved customer sentiment, and reduced employee turnover.",
    "summary": "• Studies staggered deployment of AI chat assistant for ~5,000 customer support agents. Tool built on (pre-ChatGPT) GPT-3; rollout Oct 2020 - May 2021.\n• Tool increased successfully resolved user chats by 15% per agent per hour. Time per chat declined, number of simultaneous chats per agent increased, and slightly higher % of chats are resolved successfully.\n• Most of the effect comes from newer & less skilled workers, who see 30% increase in chats resolved/hour. Tools makes workers w/ 2 months experience perform like those w/ 6 months exp. Experienced & higher skilled workers see small speed gains; best workers see small quality declines.\n• Agents who follow AI recommendations more closely have bigger productivity gains, which last even during AI API outages.\n• Biggest improvements come on \"relatively rare\" problems, where agents have less experience but AI training data exists. AI is little help on very rare problems.\n• AI improves customer satisfaction and drives reduces attrition of newer agents.",

Raw ChatGPT output scored similarly to human+AI output.\n• AI halved time spent drafting the response and doubled time spent editing. Participants were willing to pay ~0.5% of their monthly salary for ChatGPT access.\n• AI use increased job satisfaction by 0.4 SD, feelings of self-efficacy by 0.2 SD, fear of automation in subject's profession by 0.26 SD, belief that AI will boost productivity by .39 SD, and overall optimism about AI advances by 0.2 SD.\n• In follow-up survey, treatment group were more likely (33% vs 18%) to be using ChatGPT in their jobs; those who weren't mostly said it was because AI didn't have relevant context specific knowledge for their field or company.",

But at the economy-wide level, employment in those occupations actually rose slightly, because the firms with more of those workers expanded due to greater productivity gains from AI.\n• Some less-exposed occupations, like food preparation and serving, experienced declines that may be due to slower productivity gains from their employers as a result of lower AI adoption.",

The industries that have shown the biggest shifts since 2022--information, finance, and professional services--have historically had higher than average rates of volatility, with no recent increase. Overall economic volatility is lower than in the mid-twentieth century.\n• The job market for recent grads (20-24) has been changing slightly faster than for older grads (25-34) since about 2023. This could be evidence of AI disruption to labor market entrants, but the difference is small and consistent with a slowing overall labor market hitting younger workers harder.\n• Using OpenAI AI exposure estimates, they find no trends in employment or unemployment associated with relative exposure level.\n• Using Anthropic's current usage measure, they find no trend in employment or unemployment in occupations with high AI usage, whether coded as augmenting or automating usage.\n• They note data limitations: OpenAI's exposure measure captures theoretical ability for automation, not actual workplace adoption and diffusion.

    "summary": "• Two elements: survey of AI use in the workplace and analysis of AI's effects on wages and employment since 2022 using private job posting data and BLS wage data.\n• Previous surveys show varying AI adoption: a 2023 Pew survey found 20% teens used ChatGPT for schoolwork; a 2024 Pew survey similarly found 20% of American workers had used it at work at least once/year; and the biweekly US Census Business Trends and Outlook Survey found that 3.7% of firms used AI in Sept 2023 and 5.4% in Feb 2024.\n• This paper surveyed a nationally representative sample of U.S. workers and found LLM use at work rose from 30% in Dec 2024, to 43% in March/April 2025, to 46% in June/July 2025. Among LLM users, 1/3 said they used it every work day.\n• Their analysis of job postings and BLS data found that more AI-exposed occupations saw wage gains since late 2022, while employment levels and job postings did not change.",

Demand for ML programming grew by 24% relative to trend, demand for chatbot development tripled, while demand for novice workers fell overall.",

In more complex tasks, evidence is mixed on whether novice or experienced workers benefit more.\n• In writing and translation tasks, digital trace data show rising demand for AI and substitution of machines for humans, along with mild evidence of declining demand for novice workers.\n• The most recent studies show more substantial declines in demand for novice workers in AI complementary jobs.",

Senior employment doesn't change. The junior decline is driven by reduced hiring, not greater firing.",
