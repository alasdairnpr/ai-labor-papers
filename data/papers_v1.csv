Tool built on (pre-ChatGPT) GPT-3; rollout Oct 2020 - May 2021.
• Tool increased successfully resolved user chats by 15% per agent per hour. Time per chat declined, number of simultaneous chats per agent increased, and slightly higher % of chats are resolved successfully.
• Most of the effect comes from newer & less skilled workers, who see 30% increase in chats resolved/hour. Tools makes workers w/ 2 months experience perform like those w/ 6 months exp. Experienced & higher skilled workers see small speed gains; best workers see small quality declines.
• Agents who follow AI recommendations more closely have bigger productivity gains, which last even during AI API outages.
• Biggest improvements come on ""relatively rare"" problems, where agents have less experience but AI training data exists. AI is little help on very rare problems.
• AI improves customer satisfaction and drives reduces attrition of newer agents.",Experimental,Productivity Impact,US,QJE 2025 Article (open access)

They find tasks with higher AI exposure subsequently see lower labor demand[9]. Within firms, two factors matter: the average exposure of a job’s tasks (which depresses demand) and the concentration of that exposure in a few tasks (which offsets losses by allowing workers to shift to other tasks)[10]. Causal tests confirm these patterns[11][12]. Overall employment effects are modest – reduced demand in AI-exposed roles is largely offset by productivity-driven job growth at firms adopting AI[13].","• Develops new measure of task-level exposure to AI from 2010 to 2023 (largely before generative AI). 
• They identify two dimensions of exposure: the average replaceability of a job's task (higher = reduced demand) and the proportion of a job's tasks that are highly exposed (lower = offset lossess, as newly productive workers shift to other tasks).
• Within-firm employment in most exposed occupations fell by ~3% relative to least exposed occupations over the studied time period. But at the economy-wide level, employment in those occupations actually rose slightly, because the firms with more of those workers expanded due to greater productivity gains from AI.
• Some less-exposed occupations, like food preparation and serving, experienced declines that may be due to slower productivity gains from their employers as a result of lower AI adoption.",Quasi-Experimental,Employment Impact (Pre-LLM),US,SSRN Working Paper (July 2025)

Six Facts about the Recent Employment Effects of AI -- Stanford Digital Economy Lab WP,Aug 2025,"Used high-frequency payroll data (ADP) to document how U.S. jobs in AI-exposed occupations have changed since generative AI’s widespread adoption. They report that entry-level workers (age 22–25) in the most AI-exposed occupations experienced a 13% decline in employment relative to less-exposed groups (after controlling for firm shocks)[17]. Meanwhile, employment for older workers in the same jobs or for less-exposed occupations continued to grow[18]. The adjustment came mostly via reduced hiring (employment) rather than wage cuts. Losses were concentrated in roles where AI is more likely to automate (vs. augment) tasks[19]. These patterns provide early evidence that the AI revolution is disproportionately impacting junior hires in certain white-collar fields.","• Use ADP payroll data to examine changes in the labor market since the release of generative AI tools.
• Since 2022, early career workers in the most exposed jobs have seen a 13% decline in employment relative to less exposed fields and more experienced workers. The AI effect for early career workers showed up primarily in employment level, not wages.

Eckhardt, Nathan Goldschlag",AI and Jobs: The Final Word (Until the Next One) – EIG Report,Aug 2025,"Analyzed U.S. Current Population Survey data (2022–2025) using multiple occupation-level AI exposure indices. They find no evidence of AI-driven job losses so far. In fact, the unemployment rate rose less for the most AI-exposed quintile of workers (+0.3 percentage points) than for the least exposed quintile (+0.9 pp) since ChatGPT’s release[20]. Similarly, highly exposed workers did not exit the labor force at higher rates (if anything, they exit slightly less) and are not systematically shifting to less-exposed occupations. In sum, high-AI-exposure workers are, if anything, faring better in the current labor market than other workers, contradicting “job apocalypse” fears[21][20].","• Finds no aggregate effects of generative AI on the labor force in an analysis of Current Population Survey data from 2022 to 2025 using multiple job- and firm-level AI exposure measures.
• Since 2022, the unemployment rate has risen more for the least AI-exposed workers than for the most.
• The share of workers exiting the labor force is lowest (and stable) for the most exposed quintile of workers.
• The most AI-exposed quintile of workers switches occupations more often than less exposed workers, but the switching rate is lower than it was before the Covid pandemic and has not risen since 2022.
• Unemployment for young workers (22 - 27 year olds) in the most exposed quintile has risen, but less quickly and from lower levels than for young workers in other quintiles.
• Isolating to the information sector, where businesses are three times more likely than average to say they use AI, employment trends show no break with the introduction of generative AI.

"Jacob Dominski, Yong Suk Lee",Advancing AI Capabilities and Evolving Labor Outcomes (arXiv preprint),Jul 2025,"Constructed a dynamic AI Exposure indexfor occupations (using GPT-4 and Claude to assess tasks) and compared CPS outcomes before vs. after the late-2022 AI breakthrough. They find occupations with higher AI exposure saw larger declines in employment and full-time work, and bigger rises in unemployment, from late 2022 to late 2024[22][23]. The negative effects concentrate among certain groups – notably older and younger workers, men, and college-educated workers in high-exposure jobs[24]. Occupations heavy in complex reasoning tasks had greater drops in employment and hours, whereas manual task-based jobs were less affected[23]. This suggests nascent AI-driven labor shifts along both the extensive (job loss) and intensive (hours) margins, with heterogeneous impacts by demographic and task type.","• Using a novel measure of AI exposure, they analyze CPS data to identify labor market shifts after the release of ChatGPT.
• Finds that from 2022 to 2025, a 10 point increase (on a 0 to 100 scale) in AI exposure is associated with a 5-8pp decline in total employment and a 0.64-0.68pp increase in unemployment.

They find no discernible economy-wide disruption attributable to AI (yet). The pace of occupational mix change since late 2022 is only slightly above historical norms and actually predates GenAI’s introduction[25][26]. Moreover, occupations deemed more “AI-exposed” have not seen greater employment declines or higher unemployment than other occupations so far[27]. In short, despite popular anxieties, the overall U.S. job market has not (to date) shown significant AI-related dislocation, though the authors caution that better data and longer horizons are needed for future monitoring.","* Broad look at the impact of AI on the US labor market from late 2022 to late 2025.
• No discernible disruption to the aggregate labor market, but they note that past technological disruptions have taken decades, not years, to play out.
• The overall mix of jobs has changed at about the same rate as in past technological eras, and any increase in disruption started in January 2021 or before. The industries that have shown the biggest shifts since 2022--information, finance, and professional services--have historically had higher than average rates of volatility, with no recent increase. Overall economic volatilty is lower than in the mid-twentieth century.
• The job market for recent grads (20-24) has been changing slightly faster than for older grads (25-34) since about 2023. This could be evidence of AI disruption to labor market entrants, but the different is small and consistent with a slowing overall labor market hitting younger workers harder.
• Using OpenAI AI exposure estimates, they find no trends in employment or unemployment associated with relative exposure level.
• Using Anthropic's current usage measure, they find no trend in employment or unemployment in occupations with high AI usage, whether coded as augmenting or automating usage.

Bouke Klein Teeselink,Generative AI and Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from the United Kingdom(working paper),Oct 2025,"Used U.K. firm and vacancy data (2021–2025) to study differential impacts in firms/jobs with varying exposure to LLM capabilities. Results show high-LLM-exposed firms cut total employment, especially entry-level hiring. These firms sharply pulled back on new hires in technical roles (e.g. software, data analysis)[28]. At the occupation level, highly exposed roles saw fewer job postings and lower advertised salaries relative to less-exposed roles[29]. Notably, the contraction is concentrated in the high-wage segment of the labor market – high-paying firms and occupations saw significant job and pay declines, whereas low-wage jobs were largely unaffected[30]. This implies generative AI may reduce demand for certain high-skilled jobs, potentially compressing wage inequality from the top down.","• Combines private UK labor market data with a standard measure of AI exposure (Eloundou et al) to estimate the impact of AI since 2022 on employment, wages, pay dispersion, job seniority, and hiring dynamics.

They find no spike in unemployment for highly exposed jobs, but do detect a significant earnings increase for workers in high-exposure occupations after late 2022[31][32]. In other words, early adjustments to generative AI appear to be happening through wage growth (productivity gains) rather than job losses[31][32].
