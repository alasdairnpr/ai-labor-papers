            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ul class="summary-list">
              <li>Gave 400+ college educated professionals writing tasks, half of them prompted to use ChatGPT (2023).</li>
              <li>ChatGPT group took 37% less time on tasks (17 minutes vs 27 minutes), got 0.45 SD higher evaluations. In fixed-time task, ChatGPT group scored 0.39 SD better.</li>
              <li>Primarily substitution effect: 68% of treatment group submitted ChatGPT output without editing; spending longer on task after producing AI output didn&#039;t increase quality. Raw ChatGPT output scored similarly to human+AI output.</li>
              <li>AI halved time spent drafting the response and doubled time spent editing. Participants were willing to pay ~0.5% of their monthly salary for ChatGPT access.</li>
              <li>AI use increased job satisfaction by 0.4 SD, feelings of self-efficacy by 0.2 SD, fear of automation in subject&#039;s profession by 0.26 SD, belief that AI will boost productivity by .39 SD, and overall optimism about AI advances by 0.2 SD.</li>
              <li>In follow-up survey, treatment group were more likely (33% vs 18%) to be using ChatGPT in their jobs; those who weren&#039;t mostly said it was because AI didn&#039;t have relevant context specific knowledge for their field or company.</li>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Ran a randomized experiment with 453 professionals doing writing tasks, with half given access to ChatGPT. ChatGPT raised productivity substantially: average task completion time fell ~40% and output quality improved ~18%. The productivity boost was larger for weaker writers, narrowing skill disparities. Many treated workers adopted ChatGPT in their real jobs afterward.</p>
