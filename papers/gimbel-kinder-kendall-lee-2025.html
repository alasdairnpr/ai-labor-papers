            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ul class="summary-list">
              <li>Broad look at the impact of AI on the US labor market from late 2022 to late 2025.</li>
              <li>No discernible disruption to the aggregate labor market, but they note that past technological disruptions have taken decades, not years, to play out.</li>
              <li>The overall mix of jobs has changed at about the same rate as in past technological eras, and any increase in disruption started in January 2021 or before. The industries that have shown the biggest shifts since 2022--information, finance, and professional services--have historically had higher than average rates of volatility, with no recent increase. Overall economic volatility is lower than in the mid-twentieth century.</li>
              <li>The job market for recent grads (20-24) has been changing slightly faster than for older grads (25-34) since about 2023. This could be evidence of AI disruption to labor market entrants, but the difference is small and consistent with a slowing overall labor market hitting younger workers harder.</li>
              <li>Using OpenAI AI exposure estimates, they find no trends in employment or unemployment associated with relative exposure level.</li>
              <li>Using Anthropic&#039;s current usage measure, they find no trend in employment or unemployment in occupations with high AI usage, whether coded as augmenting or automating usage.</li>
              <li>They note data limitations: OpenAI&#039;s exposure measure captures theoretical ability for automation, not actual workplace adoption and diffusion. Also note that OpenAI exposure measure is only weakly correlated with Anthropic&#039;s usage measure.</li>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Took a broad, aggregate look at U.S. labor market data ~33 months after ChatGPT's debut. They find no discernible economy-wide disruption attributable to AI (yet). The pace of occupational mix change since late 2022 is only slightly above historical norms and actually predates GenAI's introduction.</p>
