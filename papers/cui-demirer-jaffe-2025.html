            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ul class="summary-list">
              <li>Pools three experiments randomizing access to Copilot among SWE at Microsoft (Sept 2022), Accenture (July 2023), and another Fortune 100 company (Oct 2023).</li>
              <li>Use of Copilot increased weekly completed tasks (pull requests) by 26%, commits by 13.5%, and number of code compiles by 38%.</li>
              <li>MSFT only: Approval rate for PRs rose 10% after Copilot adoption; other measures of quality (number of comments, number of merge conflicts, odds of approval by any reviewer) saw no significant change.</li>
              <li>MSFT only: newer employees 9% more likely to adopt Copilot and more likely to continue using, juniors 5% more likely to adopt; newer employees increase output by 27-39% with Copilot, long-tenured by 8-13%; juniors increase by 21-40%, seniors by 7-16%.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Analyzed three large RCTs at Microsoft, Accenture, and another firm (~4,867 software developers in total) where some were given GitHub Copilot (an AI code autocompletion tool). Pooled results show developers with AI completed 26% more tasks per week than the control group. Adoption and gains were higher for less-experienced developers.</p>
